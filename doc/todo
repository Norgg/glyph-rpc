done:
    move to wsgi, requests. move to params as constructor
    mapper
    transient objects
    silent server
    make_server ssl args
    carry over args to werzkeug
    form bug
    documentation
    removed prints
    split out into parts
    price checker skeleton

    refactor:
        moved to werkzeug exceptions
        change from Mapper <-> Resources
        to Router <-> Mapper <-> User Objects

    nope: mapper should only take named resources - unnamed ones can be mapped ad-hoc
        rationale: hard to do properly with linking, embedding, etc. 
    done: router should ask resources to urlify themselves?
        mapper now handles this outside router

    worker queue example

remember:
    should handle http mapping by default, verbs, urls and content_type
    should be possible to use objects outside of mapper.


todo:
    transient resources:
        better mapping to urls
        don't use query arguments to serialize dict? urlencoded glyph :v
        caching decorator?

        resource/handler has index() method returns self.__dict__ ?
        resource/handler has to_args() from_args() methods

    refactoring:
        possible: make links, forms, embeds explicit again
        possible: handle return self, self (what to do? embeds, links?)
                  glyph handles resources?
                  turn resolver into a visitor ?

    properties:
        handle @properties and produce getters and setters (GET/PUT/DELETE)
        dont expose form, expose an embed attribute with put, get, delete methods?
        hard to do properly, what do you to do embed a link, etc ? self.foo calls __get__ ....

    persistent objects:
        extend mapper with pool
        some expire, some don't ?
            raise an Exception to delete ?

    documentation:
        cookbook more examples 
            changing resources/adding methods/versioning
            doing it by hand client/server.

        examples/pricechecker/
                add loadbalancers, test caching, sharding version too


    versioning?
        map default to /v0/ , default takes a version arg
            / rreturns 300 if multiple versions

    extending behavior:
        decorators?
            @GET? @POST?  @safe? @expires @idempotent @content_type @accept @ssl_only
            knowing when to link and to form...

        overrides:
            method, content type
            url mapping, query arguments
            @resource <-> @property, allow ovveriding bits of methods?

    http client:
        requests should be optional
        handling different content-types returned?
            return binary for non text mimetypes, text otherwise.
            hate.get(url/link, options) etc?

    embeds: 
        look at hypermedia afforance list:
            safety, idempotence, mutability, nav/embed

            link ->
                mapped to a function, always get()
            form -> (mutable, navigation, non-idempotent, unsafe)
                mapped to a function with args, always post()

            embed (im/mutable, transclusion, idempotent, safe/unsafe)
                -> mapped to a propertyr - __get__ calls get,
                __set__ calls put, __del__ calls delete

            inlining:
                returning an element within a collection page
        
    collections:
        like an embed/property, but behaves with the __getitem__ calls ?
        inlining - behaves like a link, isn't.

    browser - needs content negociation, can use werkzeug templates to make html5/bootstrap interface.

    snapshoting:
        crawling an api

usecases/testcases
    atom pub mail server?  mail store? forum queue/broker(herp?)
        use preconditions to do transactional semantics?
    snmp? crawling
    scraper pool ?
        sharding, load balancing, caching, extending
    twitter api - last-modified embedding hack
            use embedded for all new items, links for all client is expected to have already
    examples for a talk?
    db cursors alike for collections ? pagination


ports:
    jquery plugin?
    ruby, js - object style
    cgi/php: create foo.php for each resource, use links.
