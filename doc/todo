            changing resources/adding methods/versioning
            doing it by hand 

    persistent objects:
        extend mapper with pool
        some expire, some don't ?

    session handling in client

    mapper:
        _ is private?
        hate.crawl() - return links ?

    properties:
        handle @properties and produce getters and setters (GET/PUT/DELETE)

    decorators?
        @GET? @POST?
        @safe? @expires @idempotent
        @content_type
        @accept
        @ssl_only

    overrides:
        method, content type
        url mapping, query arguments
    embeds: 
        look at hypermedia afforance list:
            safety, idempotence, mutability, nav/embed

            link ->
                mapped to a function, always get()
            form -> (mutable, navigation, non-idempotent, unsafe)
                mapped to a function with args, always post()

            embed (im/mutable, transclusion, idempotent, safe/unsafe)
                -> mapped to a propertyr - __get__ calls get,
                __set__ calls put, __del__ calls delete

            inlining:
                returning an element within a collection page
        
    caching?
        session handling....

    collections:
        like an embed/property, but behaves with the __getitem__ calls ?
        inlining - behaves like a link, isn't.

    snapshot?

    versioning?
        in the url? in a form?

    browser - needs content negociation, can use werkzeug templates to make html5/bootstrap interface.
